# tailwindtemplate
Default tailwind template with the default tailwindcss theme, along with inter font installed.

I was kind of getting annoyed with manually installing EVERYTHING from the ground up when I wanted a new tailwind project.

TailwindCLI built in.

Start the building with:
```
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
```

That's it. Inter font allready installed.

Enjoy!
